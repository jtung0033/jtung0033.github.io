# Welcome to Jeffrey Tung's GitHub Pages

Below included are three projects showcasing three different skillsets within the computer science industry. These three skillsets are:
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

## Software Design and Engineering
[Powerade Bottle OpenGL Project](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/tree/master/PoweradeBottle)
#### Project Description
An OpenGL C++ project recreation of a Powerade Bottle in low polygon view. This project utilizes the following libraries:
- freeglut
- opengl32
- glew32
- glu32
- SOIL

## Algorithms and Data Structures
[Vector Sorting Project](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/tree/master/VectorSorting)
#### Project Description
A C++ sorting project designed to load an excel csv file full of bids and perform the following operations:
```C++
        cout << "  1. Load Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  2. Display All Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  3. Selection Sort All Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  4. Quick Sort All Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  5. Display Limited Amount of Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  9. Exit" << endl;
```

## Databases
[PyMongo Operation Project](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/tree/master/PyMongo%20Operation)
#### Project Description
A collection of six different python programs consolidated into a centralized python project. Each of the six python program operations are separated in the two groups below:
- Mainpulation
  - Insert
  - Update
  - Delete
- Retrieval
  - Number Query
  - String Query
  - Aggregation Query

The consolidated project provides the aforementioned operations in managing a MongoDB collection created from this [stocks.json database](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/blob/master/PyMongo%20Operation/stocks.json). Direct to this [download link](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/blob/master/PyMongo%20Operation/PyMongo%20Operation%20Narrative.docx) for an in-depth narrative of this project showcasing databases.
  
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
