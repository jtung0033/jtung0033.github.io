# Welcome to Jeffrey Tung's GitHub Pages
## Professional Self Assessment

Throughout the completion of my undergraduate studies at Southern New Hampshire University, I have experienced and obtained many valuable and unique skillsets that makes myself a good candidate to be a contributing employee within the computer science field. With the completion of various courses taken at Southern New Hampshire University, I have had the opportunity to form and adhere to my own schedule while staying ahead of the deadlines provided by each of my professors. Additionally, I have also been able to experience all the different elements of working within the computer science industry with the scenarios and experiences I participated in while completing my undergraduate coursework which culminated to a collection of obtained skillsets. These different skillsets include partaking in software development in a collaborative team environment, effectively communicating to companyâ€™s stakeholders in a professional manner, as well as the computer science related skills showcased in my ePortfolio. This ePortfolio in this Github Pages website consists of three unique projects I developed to showcase my capabilities and my acquired traits. 

Each of my three artifacts in my ePortfolio showcases a different enhancement within several computer science categories displaying versatility in my capabilities. These categories involve abilities and expertise within software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, as well as database knowledge and management. Artifact one includes examples of best coding practices of modular coding, proper commenting, and management of an intricate C++ OpenGL program with various functionalities. Artifact two includes instances of utilization of data structures as well as different sorting algorithms along with the sorting performances of each sorting methods. Artifact three includes proficiency in database management within the MongoDB database and the usage of the Python programming language. 
	
As an ambitious and motivated professional looking to enter the computer science industry, I have the versatility to contribute to a wide array of different positions. In addition to my traditional academic work, I also have capabilities and credentials of a full stack web developer obtained through Udacity. After reviewing my ePortfolio, I hope to have presented myself as a positive and driven candidate for various software development and data analytics positions.

## Informal Code Review
Take a look at this [repository](https://bitbucket.org/jtung0033/code-review/src/master/Artifacts%20Code%20Review.mp4) for a code review video detailing artifacts and enhancement plans.

Below included are the finished product of three enhanced projects showcasing three different categories within the computer science industry. These three categories are:
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

## Software Design and Engineering
[Powerade Bottle OpenGL Project](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/tree/master/PoweradeBottle)

![preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/master/PoweradeBottle/Powerade%20Bottle%20Preview.png)

#### Project Description
An OpenGL C++ project recreation of a Powerade Bottle in low polygon view. This project utilizes the following libraries:
- freeglut
- opengl32
- glew32
- glu32
- SOIL

To download and setup the aforementioned libraries head to this [OpenGL Development Pack Repository](https://bitbucket.org/jtung0033/development-pack/src/master/) and follow this download link to the [PDF file](https://bitbucket.org/jtung0033/development-pack/src/master/cs330_development_installation_instructions.pdf) for instructions to set up the development pack.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
[Vector Sorting Project](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/tree/master/VectorSorting)
#### Project Description
A C++ sorting project designed to load an excel csv file full of bids and perform the following operations:
```C++
        cout << "  1. Load Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  2. Display All Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  3. Selection Sort All Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  4. Quick Sort All Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  5. Display Limited Amount of Bids" << endl;
        cout << "  9. Exit" << endl;
```

## Databases
[PyMongo Operation Project](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/tree/master/PyMongo%20Operation)
#### Project Description
A collection of six different python programs consolidated into a centralized python project. Each of the six python program operations are separated in the two groups below:
- Mainpulation
  - Insert
  - Update
  - Delete
- Retrieval
  - Number Query
  - String Query
  - Aggregation Query

The consolidated project provides the aforementioned operations in managing a MongoDB collection created from this [stocks.json database](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/blob/master/PyMongo%20Operation/stocks.json). Direct to this [download link](https://github.com/jtung0033/jtung0033.github.io/blob/master/PyMongo%20Operation/PyMongo%20Operation%20Narrative.docx) for an in-depth narrative of this project showcasing databases.
