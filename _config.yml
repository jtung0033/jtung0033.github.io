Throughout the completion of my undergraduate studies at Southern New Hampshire University, I have experienced and obtained many valuable and unique skillsets that makes myself a good candidate to be a contributing employee within the computer science field. With the completion of various courses taken at Southern New Hampshire University, I have had the opportunity to form and adhere to my own schedule while staying ahead of the deadlines provided by each of my professors. Additionally, I have also been able to experience all the different elements of working within the computer science industry with the scenarios and experiences I participated in while completing my undergraduate coursework which culminated to a collection of obtained skillsets. These different skillsets include partaking in software development in a collaborative team environment, effectively communicating to companyâ€™s stakeholders in a professional manner, as well as the computer science related skills showcased in my ePortfolio. This ePortfolio in this Github Pages website consists of three unique projects I developed to showcase my capabilities and my acquired traits. 
	Each of my three artifacts in my ePortfolio showcases a different enhancement within several computer science categories displaying versatility in my capabilities. These categories involve abilities and expertise within software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, as well as database knowledge and management. Artifact one includes examples of best coding practices of modular coding, proper commenting, and management of an intricate C++ OpenGL program with various functionalities. Artifact two includes instances of utilization of data structures as well as different sorting algorithms along with the sorting performances of each sorting methods. Artifact three includes proficiency in database management within the MongoDB database and the usage of the Python programming language. 
	As an ambitious and motivated professional looking to enter the computer science industry, I have the versatility to contribute to a wide array of different positions. In addition to my traditional academic work, I also have capabilities and credentials of a full stack web developer obtained through Udacity. After reviewing my ePortfolio, I hope to have presented myself as a positive and driven candidate for various software development and data analytics positions.
